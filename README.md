This Site is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## Local Server

Hugo comes with an integrated WebServer. You can start it with `hugo server`. 
It will start an webserver on localhost and automatically reload the page when you save your changes.

## Build

Install hugo and type `hugo`. You now find the site under `public/`.

## Deployment

The main branch is automatically deployed when changes are made. 
So just create a Pull Request with the main branch as target and 
when your changes are merged the CI will take care of them.
